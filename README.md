# Some Portfolio

*Because I couldn't come up with a better name, I went with **Some Portfolio*** ðŸ˜…

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my portfolio. You can check out the live version on [Netlify](http://markuptitan.netlify.app). If you'd like to run it locally, hereâ€™s what you need to do:

1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) installed.
2. Install `http-server` globally by running:
   ```
     npm install -g http-server
     git clone https://github.com/markuptitan/some_portfolio
     cd some_portfolio
     http-server```

My previous portfolio ([check it out here](https://markuptitan.github.io)) was an experiment that, unfortunately, has some issues:

1. Routing problems causing broken links.
2. Lacks project details.
3. Limited customization options (I lost the raw, uncompiled codebase).
So, I decided to start fresh with this one! ðŸŒŸ Itâ€™s a simpler version, built without any frameworks, and designed to keep things straightforward. It took a lot of effort, but Iâ€™m excited about the results so far.

Iâ€™ll be making more improvements along the way. Stay tuned and thanks for stopping by! ðŸš€

Cheers!
